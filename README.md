# ML Templates and Examples

This repo is largely a refactored collection of the templates from Udemy's Machine Learning A-Z and Deep Learning A-Z courses by Kirill and Hadelin. Special thanks to them for allowing me to refactor their templates!

Files are organized by simiilar classes (for example the different types of regression are in regression.py). The files in the main directory have been made more general when possible and examples of which methods are called and in which order can be found in the unittests directory.

This repo was created with the hopes of initiating projects more easily by providing a skeleton and working examples to build from.
